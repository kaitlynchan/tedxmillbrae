In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. <a class = "tedlink" id = "tedlink" target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program">TEDx</a> is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxMillsHighSchool, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxMillbrae event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>

        <p><b>Michelle Cleere, PhD</b> Bestselling author, Dr. Michelle Cleere has a PhD in Clinical Psychology and a Masters in Sport Psychology and works with elite athletes, Olympians, musicians, and professionals as a Premiere Cognitive Behavioral Coach. She lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and enjoys working with clients across the globe. Her passion is unlocking the power of the mind so that people can perform at their full potential. She works with youth and teenagers to help them learn to cope with anxiety and develop the confidence they need as athletes, musicians, and artists. 
 
She also currently teaches at John F. Kennedy University in the Sports Psychology Department. In a past life, she was a competitive triathlete and enjoyed her days coaching triathletes.
 
Dr. Cleere believes that many of the challenges facing youth today can be addressed through fostering a relationship with the brain’s activity and training our mind to cope with life’s frustrations, downfalls, changes, and defeats. Simply put, she empowers others to improve brain functioning, and ultimately performance at their best.

TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.
