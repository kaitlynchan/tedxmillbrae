In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. <a class = "tedlink" id = "tedlink" target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program">TEDx</a> is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxMillsHighSchool, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxMillbrae event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>

TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.
