						<h2><font color="red">What is TEDxMillsHighSchool?</font></h2>
						<p>
							In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. <font color="red"><a href="http://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program">TEDx</a></font> is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxMillsHighSchool, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxMillsHighSchool event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.

								<p>
									Elena Wang is a senior at Mills High School who asks too many questions for her own good. As an Asian American, she identifies with the social pressures that they face in everyday life.

Delving into the evolutionary theories behind monolids and describing her appreciation for the genetics that coded them, Elena hopes to help other Asians perceive their monolids as a special phenotypic gift from their ancestors.

							<h2>Mission: What is TED?</h2>
							<p>
								TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world. For more information, visit <font color="red"><a  href="https://www.ted.com/">www.ted.com.</a>
